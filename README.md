# ðŸš§ Check Point Firewall IP Blocker Script

This Python script automates the process of generating Check Point Firewall host addition commands for blocking a list of IP addresses. Users are prompted to input an incident number, date, PIC, and a list of IP addresses. The script formats the input data into a series of "add host" commands, which can then be executed in the Check Point Firewall environment to block the specified IP addresses.
